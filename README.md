This is a simple recipe library app that uses react native elements and navigation. The user will be able to access a preset library of recipes with the ability to add their own. On the homescreen the user can easily scroll through the recipe cards while having the option to view each recipe's details or deleting the recipe if they no longer wish to have it in the library. In the top right corner the user is able to sort their recipes alphabetically and also access the screen where they can add their own new recipe.
